I build a clone of this website [here](https://pomofocus.io/)

my application is deployed to this website [here](https://upbeat-goldstine-7d9fba.netlify.app/)

- react framework isused to build this app.
- javascript is not yet responsive
- bugs to be fixed

to run this app locally:
`git clone this_project`
`npm install` to also install dependencies like react-icons
`npm start`

happy coding!
